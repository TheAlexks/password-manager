# password-manager

I am learning C, so I decided to make something that is kinda intermediate.

## How to install?
```shell
gcc -o main.c <name of the binary>
```

## Usage
```shell
./<name of the binary> <register/delete/open>
```

`register` - make a new entry<br/>
`delete` - delete an entry<br/>
`open` - open an entry<br/>

## NOTE
Passwords are not encrypted.<br/>
Encryption will be added *soon*.
