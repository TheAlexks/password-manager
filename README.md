# password-manager

I am learning C, so I decided to make something that is kinda intermediate.

## How to install?
Git clone the repo and run `configure.sh`.<br/>
The script will compile `main.c` and copy the binary to `/usr/bin`.

## Usage
```shell
pm <register/delete/open>
```
<br/>

`register` - make a new entry<br/>
`delete` - delete an entry<br/>
`open` - open an entry<br/>

## NOTE
Passwords are **not encrypted**.<br/>
Encryption will be added *soon*.
